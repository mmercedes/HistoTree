HistoTree is a extenstion for Google's Chrome web broswer that creates a visual graph of the websites that the user visits.
The user will then be able to view and navigate to any website they have previously visited.
The extesntion will map in the websites that the users visits in a horizontal tree structure, with recently visited pages towards the top and older pages towards the bottom.
